/// This is absolutely horrible.

/// Why does it exist? PaymentsFormat, lives in Signal, not SignalServiceKit.
///
/// It can't be easily moved to SignalServiceKit either; it relies on
/// MobileCoin which isn't a SSK dependency AND it relies on PaymentsImpl
/// which also lives in Signal.
///
/// But we need PaymentsFormat, and everything it pulls in, to pull the amount string
/// out of an original message. We need the amount to generate the quoted reply; not
/// only is it displayed, it is put into the outgoing proto at send time.
///
/// This extension basically allows the initializers of DraftQuotedReplyModel (which all live
/// in Signal) to create quoted replies to payment messages but defer everything else
/// to SignalServiceKit where it should be.
///
/// Note this dance affects message sending; we NEED to create payment message quotes here,
/// in Signal, so when they are ultimately passed back down to SignalServiceKit to be sent all we
/// pass along is the already-generated payment amount display string.
