 * Manages the series of network requests and state changes required to provision
 * a linked device.
 *
 * At time of writing, despite appearing superficially similar, this class does **not**
 * mirror RegistrationCoordinator. This class does not deal at all with UI or steps
 * that require user input; it simply completes the sequence of mutations and
 * requests required behind the scenes for a device to be fully provisioned
 * _after_ it received a provisioning proto message from the primary device.
 *
 * See ProvisioningController for the sequence of UI steps that lead up to
 * this point.
 *
 * Eventually, it would be nice to mirror RegistrationCoordinator and have this
 * class behave like a state machine that handles the preceding steps as well.
