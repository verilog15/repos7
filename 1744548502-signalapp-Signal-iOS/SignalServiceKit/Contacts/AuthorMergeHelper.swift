/// Improves the performance of `AuthorMergeObserver`.
///
/// We might have messages (and related objects) stored with their address
/// specified as (ACI_A, nil), (ACI_A, E164_A), or (nil, E164_A). In this
/// case, we'd also expect to have an (ACI_A, E164_A) SignalRecipient. At
/// runtime, if we build a SignalServiceAddress for any of these messages,
/// we'll populate the missing ACI/E164 component. If some other ACI claims
/// E164_A in the future, that doesn't let them claim messages sent by the
/// old account. For the messages with ACI_A populated, this will be fine;
/// for the messages with only E164_A populated, they'd move to the new ACI.
///
/// The `AuthorMergeObserver` exists to correct this problem. If we have an
/// (ACI_A, E164_A) SignalRecipient and will change that E164 to nil or some
/// other value, we check the database to ensure all (nil, E164_A) objects
/// are updated to be (ACI_A, ?).
///
/// However, this operation is slow because it requires scanning the entire
/// messages table (and several (likely) smaller tables). Even if we did a
/// slow migration to build indexes, there still could be a large number of
/// messages to update when learning about a change number.
///
/// Enter `AuthorMergeHelper`. This class keeps track of which E164s have
/// ACI-less values in any of the relevant tables, and it will only run the
/// slow migration when absolutely necessary. Fresh installs (and likely
/// those from the past few years) will never need to run a slow migration.
/// The class works by performing a non-blocking migration to preemptively
/// assign ACIs whenever they're known.
///
/// This class also has a further optimization that should avoid the slow
/// migration even when it is "absolutely necessary". If we don't currently
/// know the ACI for a phone number, then we expect to (1) learn it at some
/// point in the future and (2) un-learn it at some further point in the
/// future. When (2) happens, we trigger the slow migration. However, we'd
/// generally expect a significant amount of time between (1) and (2) --
/// it's roughly how long an account has a particular phone number, and it's
/// generally measured in months rather than minutes. Between (1) and (2),
/// we can run our non-blocking migration again, such that by the time we
/// get to (2), the phone number no longer requires a migration.
