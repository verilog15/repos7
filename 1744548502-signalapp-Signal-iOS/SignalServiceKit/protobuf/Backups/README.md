# Backup protos

## `Swift-Protobuf`

We use [`Swift-Protobuf`](https://github.com/apple/swift-protobuf) to generate Swift code for working with `Backup.proto`, much like we do for all our other proto definitions.

However, unlike the other protos, we do not use the "wrapper" code generated by `$REPO_ROOT/Scripts/protos/ProtoWrappers.py` to wrap the `Swift-Protobuf`-generated code for Backups, because `ProtoWrappers.py` is incompatible with some of the syntactic structures we use in `Backup.proto`.
