/// Responsible for cleaning up expired ``DeletedCallRecord``s.
///
/// ``DeletedCallRecord``s are only intended to exist on-disk for as long as is
/// necessary to silently swallow events related to a call the user deleted.
/// Once that period has concluded – i.e., the ``DeletedCallRecord`` has
/// "expired" – this manager is responsible for deleting the
/// ``DeletedCallRecord``.
///
/// This manager works by finding all expired ``DeletedCallRecord``s and
/// deleting them immediately, then scheduling another cleanup (deletion) pass
/// for the expiration time of the next-expiring record, if there is one.
///
/// The manager will add a minimum delay between deletion passes to accommodate
/// multiple ``DeletedCallRecord``s with very close deletion times. For example,
/// if we have records with deletion times 10ms, 20ms, 30ms, and 40ms from now,
/// we don't want to schedule a pass for each one. Rather, if our minimum delay
/// is 1s, we'll schedule a single pass for `max(10ms, 1s)` from now, which will
/// then delete all the records.
///
/// - Note
/// "Expiration time" for a ``DeletedCallRecord`` is a function of its
/// ``DeletedCallRecord/deletedAtTimestamp`` property. Consequently, the phrase
/// "multiple records with the same expiration time" is equivalent to "multiple
/// records with the same `deletedAtTimestamp`.
