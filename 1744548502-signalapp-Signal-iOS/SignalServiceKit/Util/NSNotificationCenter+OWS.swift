            // as quickly as possible. We guard against this with an atomic
            // compare-and-swap to set the observer to nil.
            //
            // (2) When initially registering the observer, it's possible that another
            // thread could be posting the notifiation at the same time. If the
            // notification callback happens before we've assigned the initial value to
            // the atomic observer value, we'll drop that notification. We avoid that
