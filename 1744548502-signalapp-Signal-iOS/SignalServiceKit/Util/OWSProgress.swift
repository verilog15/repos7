/// A way to report partial progress on async tasks back to the caller; typically used to drive
/// some kind of loading bar UI.
///
/// You create a ``OWSProgressSink``, add ``OWSProgressSource``(s) to that sink,
/// and update progress on the sources as the long running task does its work.
///
/// The API has three goals/principles:
/// 1. Progress from multiple independent sources can be combined into a single net total output progress
/// 2. Adding child progress sources is async-friendly and thread safe
/// 3. Updating a single source is *fast* but **NOT** thread safe
///
/// Of note, workers that increment progress are assumed to be single threaded (or have their own locking).
/// If your worker is multi-threaded, you should probably generate one source per thread or locking context.
///
/// First, call ``OWSProgress/createSink(_:)`` with an observer block which is called with progress updates.
/// **WARNING**: the block is escaping and strongly held by OWSProgressSink. Beware of retain cycles.
///
/// Add one or more sources to the sink with ``OWSProgressSink/addSource(withLabel:unitCount:)``.
/// When you add a source to a sink, you update the sink's total unit count.
/// Units can mean anything; what matters is that updates to sources are measured in units,
/// and progress is reported in units. (Or percentage of units completed, via convenience var).
/// See ``Foundation/NSProgress``, which uses similar "unit" semantics.
///
/// You may add a child sink with ``OWSProgressSink/addChild(withLabel:unitCount:)``.
/// Child sinks have a unit count and can themselves have their own sources (and child sinks).
/// The completed unit count of a child sink is proportional to its children's completed unit count.
/// Put another way:
/// `parent_complete_units = parent_total_units * Sum(child_completed_units) / Sum(child_total_units)`
/// In this way a child's units are independent of its parent's (and counsins') units.
///
/// For example, say you download a file and then write rows to the db.
/// Add two child sinks: "Download" and "Write" , each with a unit count of 50.
/// Add a source to "Download" with unit count of [file byte length].
/// Add a source to "Write" with unit count of [# of rows to write to db].
/// In this way, even though "Download" and "Write" use totally different units, units of progress
/// at the root represent % complete with each counting towards 50% of the work.
/// If we download half the file, the root completed unit count would be 25 (%).
///
/// Note two other implicit advantages in the example above:
/// 1. We can determine the [# of SQL rows to write] _after_ downloading, by adding
///   the Write child at the start (proportioning 50% of the "progress" to it), but only
///   adding its source later after we've downloaded.
/// 2. A DownloadManager can have a download method that takes an ``OWSProgressSink``
///   without knowing or caring whether that sink is itself a root or a child; progress units are
///   re-normalized to parent progress units transparently to callers.
///
/// A note on ``Foundation/NSProgress``.
/// This type _looks_ like NSProgress but behaves very differently.
/// * NSProgress is a class class meant to be updated and observed with KVO.
/// OWSProgress is a snapshot-in-time struct;OWSProgressSink manages observation.
/// * NSProgress uses locks for updates, making rapid updates on a single thread expensive.
/// OWSProgress optimizes for single-threaded updates; batching observer updates to do so efficiently.
/// * NSProgress requires you to know unit counts for all children up-front and they must all share units.
/// OWSProgress lets you add children lazily and renormalizes disparate units at each level of the tree.
