synopsis: "User-space installer for liblinear"
description: """
Attempt a user-space installation of liblinear.
If successful, liblinear_train and liblinear_predict will be installed
into opam's bin directory.
Note: liblinear is a C++ software which is required by some OCaml
software in opam-repository.
Having an automatic user-space installer in opam-repos. will make those
software easier to install (e.g. even if you don't have root access
to install the liblinear system package).
