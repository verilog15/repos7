synopsis: "A formatter for OCaml based on the Topiary universal formatting engine"
description: """
Topiary is a tool in the Tree-sitter ecosystem, designed for formatter authors
and formatter users. Authors can create a formatter without having to write
their own engine or even their own parser. Users benefit from uniform code style
and the convenience of using a single formatter tool across multiple languages.

Topiary is written in Rust and developed by Tweag.
