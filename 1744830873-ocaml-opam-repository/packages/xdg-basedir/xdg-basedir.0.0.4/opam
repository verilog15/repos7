synopsis: "XDG basedir location for data/cache/configuration files"
description: """\
This library implements the xdg-basedir specification. It helps
to define standard locations for configuration, cache and data files in the
user directory and on the system. It is a straightforward implementation on
UNIX platform and try to apply consistent policies with regard to Windows
directories. It is inspired by the Haskell implementation of this
specification, and it follows the same choices for Windows directories.
[The xdg-basedir specification](http://standards.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html)
and [the Haskell implementation](http://github.com/willdonnelly/xdg-basedir)
and [the API of this implementation](http://xdg-basedir.forge.ocamlcore.org/api)."""
