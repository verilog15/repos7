This package is installed if the underlying OCaml compiler is for
32-bit Intel x86 (x86_32/x86).

Precisely, this means `ocamlopt -config-var architecture` equals `i386`.

This package may be used in depends or conflicts fields of dependent packages
to indicate either a requirement or an incompatibility with this
architecture."""
