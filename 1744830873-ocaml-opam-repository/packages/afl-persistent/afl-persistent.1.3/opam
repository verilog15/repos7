"afl-persistent is installed, but since the current OCaml compiler does
not enable AFL instrumentation by default, most packages will not be
instrumented and fuzzing with afl-fuzz may not be effective.

To globally enable AFL instrumentation, use an OCaml switch such as
4.07.1+afl." {success & afl-available & !afl-always}

description: """
afl-fuzz normally works by repeatedly fork()ing the program being
tested. using this package, you can run afl-fuzz in 'persistent mode',
which avoids repeated forking and is much faster."""
