synopsis: "One-file filesystem is a filesystem for storing a single unnamed file"
description: """
One-file filesystem is a filesystem for storing a single unnamed file. It is
suitable for storing data that may be lost on updates. For example a cache of
pre-computed cryptographic checksums that are slow to compute, but that we
would rather recompute than have stale checksums.
CRC32 checksums are used to ensure integrity.
