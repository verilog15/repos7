synopsis: "Compiler for the Heptagon/BZR synchronous programming language"
description: """
Heptagon/BZR is a synchronous dataflow language whose syntax and
semantics is inspired from Lustre, with a syntax allowing the
expression of control structures (e.g., switch or mode automata).
Heptagon/BZR is a research compiler, whose aim is to facilitate
experimentation. The current version of the compiler includes the
following features:
- Inclusion of discrete controller synthesis within the compilation
- Expression and compilation of array values with modular memory optimization
See http://heptagon.gforge.inria.fr for further informations."""
