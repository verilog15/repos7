synopsis: "The ez_search library"
description: """\
ez_search is a library for indexing files and searching content with rexgexps.
It creates a dababase of two files (one with the raw files, one with the 
index) on disk. 
The database can then be searched for occurrences of regexps, using
either [Re] or [Str]. Direct string matching and case insensitive searches 
are also supported.
Ez_search can [mmap] the database to decrease its memory footprint, and
[Parmap] to search the database on multiple cores in parallel (in which case
the results may overlap).
It also provides a "context extraction" feature to display lines above and 
after an occurrence.
