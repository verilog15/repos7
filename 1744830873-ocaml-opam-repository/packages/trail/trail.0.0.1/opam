  "A minimalistic, composable web framework for building HTTP/WebSocket servers"
description:
  "Trail is a minimalistic, composable framework for building HTTP/WebSocket servers for Riot, inspired by Elixir's Plug & WebSock. It provides you with a small set of abstractions for building _trails_ that can be assembled to handle a request. This includes a logger, a router, a socket endpoint, an interface to handling web socket frames, and more"
