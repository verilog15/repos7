synopsis: "User-space installer for libsvm's tools"
description: """
Attempt a user-space installation of libsvm.
While liblinear can be considered a chainsaw for machine learning,
libsvm is a swiss knife in the same field.
If successful, libsvm_train and libsvm_predict will be installed
into opam's bin directory.
Note: libsvm is a C++ software which is required by some OCaml
software in opam-repository.
Having an automatic user-space installer in opam-repository will make those
software easier to install (e.g. even if you don't have root access
to install the libsvm system package).
