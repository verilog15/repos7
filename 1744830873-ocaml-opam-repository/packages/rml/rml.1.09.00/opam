  "ReactiveML: a programming language for implementing interactive systems."
description: """
ReactiveML is based on the synchronous reactive model embedded in an ML
language (here a subset of OCaml). It provides synchronous parallel
composition and dynamic features like the dynamic creation of processes.
In ReactiveML, the reactive model is integrated at the language level
(not as a library) which leads to safer and more natural programming."""
