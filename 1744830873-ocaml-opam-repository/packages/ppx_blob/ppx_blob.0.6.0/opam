synopsis: "Include a file as a string at compile time"
description:
  "ppx_blob allows you to include a binary blob from a file as a string. Writing `[%blob \"filename\"]` will replace the string with the contents of the file at compile time. This allows the inclusion of arbitary, possibly compressed, data, without the need to respect OCaml's lexical conventions."
