synopsis: "Compile-time configuration for Jane Street libraries"
description: "
Defines compile-time constants used in Jane Street libraries such as Base, Core, and
Async.

This package has an unstable interface; it is intended only to share configuration between
different packages from Jane Street. Future updates may not be backward-compatible, and we
do not recommend using this package directly.
