opam-version: "2.0"
synopsis: "Select the mingw-w64 Windows port of OCaml"
description: """
This package simply causes system-mingw to be selected.

It's a legacy package from the "temporary" packaging of the mingw-w64 port of
OCaml provided by @dra27 during 2022 and 2023, which is why there is no -msvc
equivalent."""
