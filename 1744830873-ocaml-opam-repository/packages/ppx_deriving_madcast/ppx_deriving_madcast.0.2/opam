synopsis: "Library deriving cast functions based on their types"
description: """
This package provides a PPX that allows to derive cast functions based
on their types.

For instance, `[%madcast: ('a * string) -> ('a * int)]` would be replaced by:

    fun (x, y) ->
      (x,
       try int_of_string y
       with Failure _ -> failwith "madcast: string -> int")
