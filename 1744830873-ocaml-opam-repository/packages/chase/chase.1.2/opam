synopsis: "Model finder for geometric theories using the chase"
description: """
The chase program is a model finder for first order logic with
equality.  It finds minimal models of a theory expressed in geometric
form, where functions in models may be partial.  A formula is in
geometric form if it is a sentence consisting of a single implication,
the antecedent is a conjunction of atomic formulas, and the consequent
is a disjunction.  Each disjunct is a possibly existentially
quantified conjunction of atomic formulas.  A function is partial if
it is defined only on a proper subset of its domain.
