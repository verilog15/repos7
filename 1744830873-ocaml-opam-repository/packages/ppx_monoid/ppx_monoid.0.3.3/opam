synopsis: "Syntax extension for building values of monoids"
description: """
This is a syntax extension for OCaml to make building values of
monoids easier. Assumes the existence of two operations in scope for
some type `t`:

````ocaml
empty : t
(^^)  : t -> t -> t
````

`ppx-monoid`, triggered by the PPX extension point `monoid`,
reinterprets the semicolon `;` to mean the monoid operation `^^` and
the unit expression `()` to mean `empty`."""
