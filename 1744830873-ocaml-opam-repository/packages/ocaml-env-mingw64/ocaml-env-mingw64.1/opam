synopsis: "GCC mingw-w64 OCaml Runtime Dependency (64-bit)"
description: """
This package is an internal part of the implementation of the OCaml compiler in
opam-repository.

This package is used to create an indirection between the OCaml compiler
packages and conf-mingw-w64-gcc-i686. The compiler packages must have one of
conf-mingw-w64-gcc-i686 or conf-mingw-w64-gcc-x86_64 depending on configuration,
but if they directly refer to both packages in their depends fields then the
subsequent installation of the _other_ C compiler package would trigger a
rebuild of the OCaml compiler package, because it changes its dependency cone.
By having the compiler packages instead depend on either ocaml-env-mingw64 or
ocaml-env-mingw32, the installation of conf-mingw-w64-gcc-i686 into a switch
already containing ocaml-env-mingw64 does not trigger a rebuild of the OCaml
compiler, because ocaml-env-mingw32 is not installed."""
