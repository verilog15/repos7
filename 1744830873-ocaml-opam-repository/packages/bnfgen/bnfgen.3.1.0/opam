synopsis:
  "Random text generator that takes context-free grammars from BNF files"
description: """\
BNFGen generates random texts based on user-defined context-free grammars
specified in a BNF-like syntax. There are descriptive syntax error messages
and tracing options.

You can specify "weight" for rules with alternation to influence their probabilities.
For example, in `<foo> ::= 10 <foo> "foo" | "foo";` the first (recursive) option will be
taken ten times more often.

You can also specify deterministic repetition ranges, like `<foo>{4}` (exactly four of `<foo>`)
or `<foo>{1,5}` (from one to five of `<foo>`).

This package includes both a library and a CLI tool based on it."""
