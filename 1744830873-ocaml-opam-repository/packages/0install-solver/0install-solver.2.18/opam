description: """
A package dependency resolver based on a SAT solver. This was originally
written for the 0install package manager, but is now generic and is also used
as a solver backend for opam.
The SAT solver is based on MiniSat (http://minisat.se/Papers.html) and
the application to package management is based on OPIUM (Optimal Package
Install/Uninstall Manager). 0install-solver uses a (novel?) strategy to find
the optimal solution extremely quickly (even for a SAT-based solver).
