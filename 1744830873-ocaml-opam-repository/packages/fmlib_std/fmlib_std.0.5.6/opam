synopsis: "Standard datatypes of Fmlib"

description: """

Some small wrappers around ocamls stdlib modules to facilitate more functional
programming. E.g. the module 'Option' and 'Result' support the 'let*' operator.
The module 'Array' has a 'push' operation to append functionally elements at the
end.

Besides some wrapper around Stdlib modules it has the additional modules:

- Deque: A double ended queue with efficient pushing of elements from the front
  and the rear end and efficient popping of elements from the front end.

- Btree: Finite sets and maps based on B trees. B trees have better cache
  efficiency and locality than AVL or Redblack trees.
