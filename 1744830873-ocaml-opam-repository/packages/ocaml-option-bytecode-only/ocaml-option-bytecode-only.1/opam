  # See equivalent constraint in ocaml-options-vanilla
  # Windows is permitted to install 32-bit versions of ocaml-base-compiler on
  # 64-bit systems hence the (temporary) addition of the `os = "win32"` here,
  # at least until the ocaml-option- / base- mess is fixed. Note that this puts
  # 64-bit Windows into the same class as ppc64, riscv64 and s390x where
  # ocaml-option-bytecode-only can be installed, but has no effect.
