synopsis: "Tools and APIs for program analysis, code visualization, refactoring"
description: """
pfff is a set of tools and APIs to perform some static analysis,
dynamic analysis, code visualizations, code navigations, or
style-preserving source-to-source transformations such as refactorings
on source code. For now the effort is focused on Javascript and Python
but there is also good support for C, C++, Java, PHP, HTML, Css, and
preliminary support for Erlang, Go, C#, Lisp, Scheme, Haskell, Skip, Sql, and
even TeX. There is also very good support for OCaml and noweb
(literate programming) so that pfff can be used on the code of pfff
itself.
