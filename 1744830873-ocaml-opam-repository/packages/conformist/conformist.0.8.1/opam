  "Conformist allows you to define schemas to decode, validate and sanitize input data declaratively"
description: """
Conformist allows you to define schemas to decode, validate and sanitize input data declaratively.
It comes with runtime types for primitive OCaml types such as `int`, `string`, `bool` and `float` but also `Ptime.t`, `option` and custom types.
Re-use business rules in validators and run it on the client side with js_of_ocaml.
Arbitrary meta data can be stored in schemas which is useful to build functionality on top of conformist.
