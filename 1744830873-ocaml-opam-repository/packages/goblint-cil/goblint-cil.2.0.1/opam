synopsis:
  "A front-end for the C programming language that facilitates program analysis and transformation"
description: """
This is a fork of the 'cil' package used for 'goblint'. Major changes include:
* Support for C99 and C11.
* Compatibility with modern OCaml versions.
* Use Zarith instead of Num and use that for integer constants.
* Improved locations with columns and spans.
* Removal of unmaintained extensions and MSVC support.
* Use dune instead of make and ocamlbuild.
* Many bug fixes."""
