description: """
Installing this package makes the hol-light package to build the
bytecode and native module of HOL Light core as well.

NOTE: This extends the trusted base of HOL Light to include its inliner script,
inline_loads.ml. inline_loads.ml is an OCaml program in HOL Light that receives
an HOL Light proof and replaces the loads/loadt/needs function invocations with
their actual contents. Please install this package only if having this
additional trusted base is considered okay.
