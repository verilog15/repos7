description: """
This package will expose variable an environment variable
`TRAVIS_<VAR>` as an opam variable `conf-env-travis:<var>`, e.g.,
`TRAVIS_OS_NAME` can be accessed as `conf-env-travis:os_name`.

A variable `active` would be set to true, if travis environment was
detected.  All variables except `active` are delimited with quotes."""
