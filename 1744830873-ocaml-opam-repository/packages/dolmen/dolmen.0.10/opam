synopsis: "A parser library for automated deduction"
description:
"Dolmen aims at providing tools to help in writing programs in the field of theorem proving,
SMT solving, and model checking. The project includes a few libraries, a CLI binary and an
LSP server, split over several opam packages.

This is the Dolmen parser library. It currently targets languages used in automated theorem provers,
as well as model checking, and may be extended to other domains later.

Dolmen provides functors that takes as arguments a representation of terms and statements,
and returns a module that can parse files (or streams of tokens) into the provided representation
of terms or statements. This is meant so that Dolmen can be used as a drop-in replacement of existing
parser, in order to factorize parsers among projects.

Additionally, Dolmen also provides a standard implementation of terms and statements that can be
used to instantiate its parsers."
