description: """

Package lreplay is part of the LTest suite, which includes tools to manage test objectives,
 expressed as labels and hyperlabels. lreplay runs a given test suite and computes
 the corresponding coverage according the labels and hyperlabels defined in its input
 files. The other LTest tools are Frama-C plugins including:
 - Lannotate, for generating (hyper)labels according to various criteria
 - Luncov, for identifying uncoverable and/or redundant (hyper)labels
