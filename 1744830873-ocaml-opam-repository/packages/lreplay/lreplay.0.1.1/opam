synopsis: "Executes a test suite and computes test coverage"
description: """
Lreplay is part of the LTest suite, which includes tools to manage test
objectives, expressed as labels and hyperlabels. lreplay runs a given test suite
and computes the corresponding coverage according the labels and hyperlabels
defined in its input files. The other LTest tools are Frama-C plugins including:
- Lannotate, for generating (hyper)labels according to various criteria
- Luncov, for identifying uncoverable and/or redundant (hyper)labels
