# The architecture selection is somewhat belt-and-braces while this system is
# only available for Windows. The dependency of the OCaml ecosystem on either
# Cygwin or MSYS2 means that OCaml cannot be used on 32-bit Windows, although
# 32-bit is fully supported as a target.
# When these packages are extended to all platforms, the available field would
# ensure that this package becomes unavailable on a 32-bit system, and the
# avoid-version in arch-x86_32 will be ignored.
