synopsis: "Bisector tree implementation in OCaml"
description: """
A bisector tree allows to do fast but exact nearest neighbor searches
in any space provided that you can measure the
distance between any two points in that space.
A bisector tree also allows fast neighbor searches (range queries/
finding all points within a given tolerance from your query point).
Cf. this article for details:
'A Data Structure and an Algorithm for the Nearest Point Problem';
Iraj Kalaranti and Gerard McDonald.
