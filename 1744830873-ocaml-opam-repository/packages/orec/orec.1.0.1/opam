synopsis: "dynamic open records"
description: """
Orec's open records make it possible to dynamically create, access,
update, and assign fields of an "open record" value with a syntax
somewhat similar to the normal record syntax.

The underlying implementation relies on heterogeneous maps for storing
the field data and a liberal use of GADTs and extended indexing
operators to expose a higher-level interface on the top of those
hetereogeneous maps."""
