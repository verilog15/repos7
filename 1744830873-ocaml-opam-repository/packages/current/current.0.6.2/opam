synopsis: "Pipeline language for keeping things up-to-date"
description: """\
OCurrent provides an OCaml eDSL for writing CI/CD pipelines.

It is used in ocaml-ci (which provides CI for OCaml projects on GitHub),
and in docker-base-images (a pipeline that builds Docker images for various
Linux distributions, OCaml compiler versions and CPU types, and pushes them
to Docker Hub).

A pipeline is written much like you would write a one-shot sequential script,
but OCurrent will automatically re-run steps when the inputs change, and will
run steps in parallel where possible."""
