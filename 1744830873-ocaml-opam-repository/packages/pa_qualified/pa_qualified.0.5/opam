synopsis:
  "A syntax extension that implements support for fully qualified module references"
description: """
Pa_qualified adds support for fully qualified module references to OCaml.
If a module reference (in any possible context) starts with "Q.", then
the rest of the reference denotes a context-independent globally unique
path (as if the reference was located at the very beginning of the file).
Qualified references can never be shadowed by other definitions
(warranty void if "Q" is defined explicitly somewhere)."""
