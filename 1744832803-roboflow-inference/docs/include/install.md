!!! Info
    Prior to installation, you may want to configure a [python virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html) to isolate dependencies of inference.

To install Inference via pip:

```bash
pip install inference
```

If you have an NVIDIA GPU, you can accelerate your inference with:

```bash
pip install inference-gpu
```
