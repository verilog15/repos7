## Add `IsPrime` to `math` package

Quickly determine if a given number is prime using the 6k Â± 1 method.

All integers (excluding 2 and 3), can be expressed as (6k + i), where i = -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4. Since 2 divides (6k + 0), (6k + 2), and (6k + 4), while 3 divides (6k + 3) that leaves only (6k - 1) and (6k + 1) for expressing primes

## Fix possible memory leak

A possible memory leak in the process package was fixed.

## Update supported FreeBSD to FreeBSD 13.0

As of this release, we now do all FreeBSD testing on FreeBSD 13.0 and all ponyc prebuilt packages are built on FreeBSD 13.0. We will make a best effort to not break prior versions of FreeBSD while they are "supported".
