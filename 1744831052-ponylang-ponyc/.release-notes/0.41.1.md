## Fix type constraint check against NullablePointer being omitted in FFI declarations

This release fixes an issue where the compiler would not perform some type checks against FFI declarations. Specifically, the compiler would fail to validate that the type parameter to the `NullablePointer` type had to be a struct type. This check is important since a program that used a non-struct type in a `NullablePointer` could theoretically segfault at runtime.
