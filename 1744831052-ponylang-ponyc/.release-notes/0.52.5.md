## Fix compiler crash when attempting to mutate a val field

In Pony 0.52.4 we fixed an unsoundness bug that had been introduced over the summer. While fixing that bug, an error case was missed and as a result, a compiler crash was created where an error message should have been generated.

We've fixed the crash and it now displays a "left side is immutable" error message.
