/* A build flag set records the platform and user build flags required for some
 * ifdef and/or use guard expression and enumerates through the possible
 * configs for those flags.
 *
 * To use a build flag set first add all the required symbols with the `add`
 * function and then enumerate with the `startenum` and `next` functions. Once
 * `startenum` is called no more flags may be added.
 *
 * The number of possible configs can be read at any time and is intended for
 * warnings to the user when there are many configs to check, which might take
 * a long time.
 *
 * Note that some platform flags, such as the OS flags, are mutually exclusive
 * and build flag sets know this. Thus if any OS flag is added all known OSes
 * will be included in the enumeration.
 *
 * All user flags are assumed to be independent.
 *
 * Although platform and user flags are presented with slightly different
 * syntax in the Pony source, we require them to be in a single namespace.
 * Therefore build flag sets do not distinguish between them.
 *
 * All flag names must be passed as stringtab'ed strings.
