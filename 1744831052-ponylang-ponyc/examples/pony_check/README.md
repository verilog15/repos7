# pony_check

A program showing example tests using the PonyCheck property based testing package.

## How to compile

With a minimal Pony installation, in the same directory as this README file, run `ponyc`. You should see content building the necessary packages, which ends with:

```console
...
Generating
 Reachability
 Selector painting
 Data prototypes
 Data types
 Function prototypes
 Functions
 Descriptors
Optimising
Writing ./pony_check.o
Linking ./pony_check
```

## How to Run

Once `pony_check` has been compiled, in the same directory as this README file, run `./pony_check`. You should see a PonyTest runner output showing the tests run and their results; just like you would with PonyTest in general, except the tests in question are PonyCheck tests.
