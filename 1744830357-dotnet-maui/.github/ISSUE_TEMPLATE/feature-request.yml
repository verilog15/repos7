        Thank you for your interest in .NET MAUI! We welcome any and all ideas for features or improvements that you might have. All we ask is to fill in this template with some detail. A detailed description, perhaps supported with some screenshots, mockups, and a (public) API design in pseudo-code, would be very much appreciated and will help get your proposal reviewed sooner.
        
        Keep in mind that .NET MAUI is a multi-platform framework. Consider how feasible it is to implement this feature across all the supported platforms.
        
        If you're not completely sure about a request yet, feel free to [open a discussion](https://github.com/dotnet/maui/discussions/new?category=ideas) first to discuss with the team and the community first.

      label: Description
      description: Please give us a detailed description of the feature that you envision. Focus on _what_ this feature does, over the _why_ you want this feature. What would be the end-result when implemented? Feel free to add any diagrams, (mocked up) screenshots, or other materials that support your story.
      placeholder: I would love to have a button that I can make shiny. This is something that is supported on all the underlaying platforms, so this would just be exposing that on the .NET MAUI layer.

      description: Include a list of all API changes, additions, subtractions as would be required by your proposal. These APIs should be considered placeholders, so the naming is not as important as getting the concepts correct. If possible you should include some example (pseudo-)code of usage of your new API. This will not only help us understand better, but also help you think about how you want to use this feature as a developer.

        ```csharp
        var button = new Button ();
        button.MakeShiny = true; // new API
        ```
        
        The MakeShiny API works even if the button is already visible.

      label: Intended Use-Case
      description: Provide a detailed example of where your proposal would be used and for what purpose. Focus on _why_ you want this feature instead of _what_ the feature does.
      placeholder: In my app I have a situation where I would really want a shiny button to make it stand out from the rest of the plain and boring buttons.
